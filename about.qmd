Hi! My name is Yewon (pronounced Yeah-Won) Kang. I am a 2nd year PhD student in Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota. My research focuses on cognitive processes related to **learning**, **memory**, and **source credibility** and their **applications in education**. I am currently working in the [Reading + Learning Lab](https://edpsych.umn.edu/research/labs/reading-learning), advised by Dr. Panayiota Kendeou. I also serve as the [Instructional Technology Fellow](https://academics.cehd.umn.edu/digital-education/yewon-kang/) for the School of Social Work, assisting instructors in making effective use of educational technology tools and resources.
